name: General question
about: Questions about Nengo, help with models, etc.

We are happy to help with all kinds of questions about Nengo, such as:

- How do I do [...] in Nengo?
- Where can I find more information about [...]?
- I built a neural model, but it isn't working properly. What's wrong?

However, we find that the [Nengo forum](https://forum.nengo.ai/) is a
much better venue for these kinds of open-ended discussions.

So rather than opening a Github issue please go to the forum at
https://forum.nengo.ai/ and post your question there, and we'll be
happy to help you!
